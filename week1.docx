DevOps Lifecycle
The DevOps lifecycle optimizes development processes from start to end and engages the organization in continuous development, resulting in faster delivery times. This process mainly consists of the following seven stages.

1. Continuous development
 Continuous development involves planning and coding the software. Here, the entire development process gets broken down into smaller development cycles. This process makes it easier for the DevOps team to accelerate the overall software development process. This phase is instrumental in mapping the vision for the entire development cycle, enabling developers to fully understand project expectations. Through this, the team starts visualizing its end goal as well.
2. Continuous integration
 Continuous integration (CI) includes different steps related to the execution of the test process. Along with this, clients also provide information to be incorporated for adding new features to the application. Most changes happen in the source code during this phase. CI becomes the hub for resolving these frequent changes on a daily or monthly basis. Building code is a combination of unit and integration testing, code review, and packaging. Since developers make frequent changes, they can quickly spot problems (if any) and resolve them at an early stage.
3. Continuous testing
 Next in the DevOps lifecycle is the testing phase, wherein the developed code is tested for bugs and errors that may have made their way into the code. This is where quality analysis (QA) plays a major role in checking the usability of the developed software. Successful completion of the QA process is crucial in determining whether the software meets the client’s specifications.
4. Continuous deployment 
Continuous deployment (CD) ensures hassle-free product deployment without affecting the application’s performance. It is necessary to ensure that the code is deployed precisely on all available servers during this phase. This process eliminates the need for scheduled releases and accelerates the feedback mechanism, allowing developers to address issues more quickly and with greater accuracy.

5. Continuous monitoring 
Monitoring the performance of a software product is essential to determine the overall efficacy of the product output. This phase processes important information about the developed app. Through continuous monitoring, developers can identify general patterns and gray areas in the app where more effort is required.

6. Continuous feedback 
Continuous feedback is essential to ascertain and analyze the final outcome of the application. It sets the tone for improving the current version and releasing a new version based on stakeholder feedback.  The overall process of app development can only be improved by analyzing the results from the software operations. Feedback is nothing but information gathered from the client’s end. Here, information is significant, as it carries all the data about the performance of the software and its related issues. It also contains suggestions given by end users of the software.

7. Continuous operations 
The last stage in the DevOps lifecycle is the shortest and easiest to grasp. Continuity is at the heart of all DevOps operations that helps automate release processes, allows developers to detect issues quickly, and build better versions of software products. Continuation is key to eliminate diversions and other extra steps that hinder development.

DevOps Best Practices
1. Version Control For All Production Artifacts
Both Dev and Ops should use version control for everything. And they should share the same single source of truth.
2. Continuous Integration and Deployment
Check in code every day and check into the trunk every day, as opposed to hanging onto private code branches and integrating only at the end of the release. 
3. Automated Acceptance Testing
Stop the line not only when the build breaks but also when something breaks. This is true for all software testing, whether it's an automated user test, an integration test, or a system test. This step keeps things in an always-deployable state.
4. Peer Review of Production Changes
Use peer review for better quality; leverage your team’s familiarity, shared goals, and mutual accountability, as opposed to external change approval (such as a change advisory board).
5. High-Trust Culture
This is both a practice and an outcome result from a single source of truth, peer reviews, and shared goals.
6. Proactive Monitoring of the Production Environment
Monitor and communicate across the teams so everyone can see, understand, and affect end results and customer utilization.
SRE vs DevOps Engineers: What’s The Difference?
Both professions enforce minimal separation between Development and Operations teams. But we can sum up the key difference as this: DevOps focuses more on a cultural and philosophical shift, and SRE is more pragmatic and practical. Site reliability engineering mainly focuses on enhancing system availability and reliability while DevOps focuses on speed of development and delivery while enforcing continuity.
