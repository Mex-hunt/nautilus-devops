CREATING GROUPS AND USERS

First I clogged into my machine as a root user with sudo -i command 

I created groups using the groupadd command, namely group1,group2,group3

I created users with the useradd command to add 15 users

I used the usermod -a -G group1 user1 to add users to respective groups, changing the groups and users




2. To find the string packets in the path var/log

grep “packets” var/log
